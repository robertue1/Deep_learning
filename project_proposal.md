# Traffic signs classification using Convolutional Neural Networks. 




When fully deployed for the masses to use, self-driving cars will be able to reduce the number of deaths due to traffic accidents in the US and worldwide, while also 
enabling new and more effective ways of mobility. There are plenty of technological challenges that we need to overcome in order to enjoy the advantages of autonomous vehicles, one being 
traffic signs classification, that is why, this project, I'll be using data from the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](https://sid.erda.dk/public/archives/daaeac0d7ce1152aea9b61d9f1e19370/published-archive.html),
to create a model capable of classify the traffic signs, with the intention of making this one of the building blocks of a self-driving vehicle. 


The data is made of more than 50.000 images, with a total of 43 label classes. 

An MVP for this project, will consist on a baseline Convolutional Network Model capable of assigning a label to unseen traffic signs.
